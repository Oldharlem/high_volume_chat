## Scaling Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- Message pagination with infinite scroll
- Proper database indexing for frequent queries
- N+1 query prevention with includes
- Real-time updates via ActionCable
- Caching of group memberships

### Future Scaling Solutions

1. Database Scaling:
   - Partition messages by date or group_id
   - Consider moving older messages to cold storage
   - Implement read replicas for message queries

2. Caching Layer:
   - Add Redis for caching and pub/sub
   - Cache frequently accessed messages
   - Cache group membership lists

3. Background Processing:
   - Move message broadcasting to Sidekiq
   - Add message search indexing with Elasticsearch
   - Handle notifications asynchronously

4. Application Scaling:
   - Add load balancing
   - Scale ActionCable servers separately
   - Consider breaking into microservices

5. Monitoring and Analytics:
   - Add NewRelic/Scout for performance monitoring
   - Track message metrics with StatsD/Datadog
   - Set up error tracking with Sentry
